# flask
simple portfolio using flask.

structure :-
created a folder name portfolio whhere app.py is my main file . 
Then created a folder named templates where my html files are placed.
later created a folder named static where my css file is placed.

terms new to me :-
1.templates  
   Folder that contains all HTML pages. Flask looks here for render_template().

2. static 
   Folder for static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

3. @app.route()  
    Defines URL paths. Each route connects a webpage (like '/', '/contact') to a function.

4. render_template()  
    Loads and displays an HTML page from the templates folder.

5. request  
    Used to handle form data sent from the website (like name, email, message).

6. app.run(debug=True)  
   Starts the Flask development server.
